# Application-Web-pour-le-Calcul-du-Coefficient-de-Diffusion
Diffusion Coefficient Calculator
Description
This project is a Diffusion Coefficient Calculator that computes the diffusion coefficient DAB for a binary mixture using a mathematical model. The application is built with Python and uses the Flask framework for the web interface. It also integrates pywebview to provide a standalone desktop application experience.
The calculator takes inputs such as mole fractions, volume parameters, interaction parameters, and temperature to compute the diffusion coefficient. It also compares the calculated value with an experimental reference value to determine the relative error.
Features:
User-friendly interface: Built with Flask and rendered using HTML/CSS.
Standalone desktop app: Uses pywebview to run the application in a desktop window.
Error handling: Includes robust error handling for invalid inputs and unexpected errors.
Dynamic results: Displays the calculated diffusion coefficient and relative error in real-time.
Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language.
Flask: A lightweight web framework for building the application.
pywebview: A library to create a desktop GUI for the Flask app.
NumPy: Used for mathematical computations.
HTML/CSS: For the user interface design.
